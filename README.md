experiments in combining LeSS with Autoprefixer as a node.js module

primarily aimed at reducing the overhead in a 
[python-based predecessor](https://github.com/InsurrectionistIllness/less-prefixed), by:
  
 * not invoking the Python interpreter
 * avoiding having to write the intermediate files to disk (or NAS, in my case)  

## TODO:

 * get it into a usable state
 * take options for LeSS and Autoprefixer
 * add better docs
 * ...publish it to npm?
